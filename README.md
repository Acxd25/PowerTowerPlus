# Power Tower Plus  

Adds 2 new modified Power Towers with increased connections, separate power grid lines and logistical supports.  

Uses vanilla tower models. Adds 1 new model for the modified single main line.  
<br>

<b>Modified:</b>  
- Changed tower connections from 3 to 8.  
- Removed the 2 lines that connect the towers together and replaced with a single line above.  
-  The 2 lines now operate on their own connectors, allowing you to run separate power grids on them.  
-  Added 2/4 additional power connectors, allowing you to run 5/7 separate power grids from a single tower.  
-  Added 4 conveyor belt supports and 2 pipeline supports.  

##### Power Tower Plus
-  5 Separate power lines (Including the towers main line).  
-  0 belt/pipeline supports.  

##### Power Tower Platform Plus
-  7 Separate power lines.

BEST used with [Andre's Flex Spines Mod](https://ficsit.app/mod/FlexSplines) and [David's Cable Choices Mod](https://ficsit.app/mod/AB_CableMod).  
This will allow you to run the belts/pipes/cables at a longer range without placing towers closer to eachother.
